🎮 Gamepad2Mouse
Ever wanted to control your PC with an Xbox controller like a total boss?
Now you can. This project turns your Xbox controller into a full-blown mouse and keyboard substitute.
Use the joystick to glide your cursor, press A and B to click, and tap Start to pop open an on-screen keyboard like magic.
Oh, and it actually feels smooth—not like the weird clunky stuff you find online.

✨ Features
🕹️ Use left joystick for buttery-smooth cursor movement

🖱️ A button for left click, B button for right click

⌨️ Start button toggles the Windows on-screen keyboard

🧠 Built-in deadzone and acceleration curve for better control

⚡ Fast, responsive, and actually usable
